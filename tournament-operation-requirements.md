## Foreword

Counter-Strike is at its best when teams compete on a level playing field and when ability is the only limit to their success. And we think that Counter-Strike should be an open sport. So below, we describe new requirements to running large-scale competitive tournaments.

Briefly, these rules limit the ability to directly invite teams to tournaments, enforce transparency in compensation, and define the types of tournaments we will consider in our official ranking system.

If you're interested in running a Counter-Strike tournament you will need a license from Valve. In many cases the Limited Game Tournament License (https://store.steampowered.com/tourney/limited_license) will cover your tournament. However, if you want to operate at a scale that exceeds the limited license, you must contact Valve to obtain a broader license.

For any questions or exception requests, contact csgoteamfeedback@valvesoftware.com, subject: "tournament operation requirements.”

## Tournament Operating Requirements

The version of the Tournament Operation Requirements that apply to a Tournament is [the version that was current](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/counter-strike_rules_and_regs/commits/main/tournament-operation-requirements.md) as of the Tournament's Additional Information deadline.

### 1. Definitions

1.1 **"Valve Regional Standings"** or **"VRS"** shall mean the official system for ranking the performance of Rosters published by Valve, which is published monthly and shall be the basis for Direct VRS Invites.

b) The Participating Roster satisfies the invite criteria (e.g. regional, demographic, etc).

3.5 **Open Qualifiers.**

3.6 **Wildcard Invite.** 

3.6.1 For every 8 Rosters invited from a VRS, 2 eligible Rosters ("**Wildcard Invite**") can be invited to the Tournament. 

3.6.2 If Tournament Operator chooses not to make use of previously announced Wildcard invitations, they may invite the next highest ranked Rosters from the VRS lists already announced for the Tournament.

3.6.3 A Roster shall only be eligible for a Wildcard Invite if it is ranked lower than 12 on the Global VRS list and it fulfills at least one of the following requirements as of the Invitation Date:

a) It includes at least 3 players who individually were members of a top 12 Roster on an Invite VRS List at any time during the preceding 6 months.

b) It has placed first or second place in any Tournament, of equal or lesser tier than the one issuing the invite, during the preceding 6 months.

3.8.3 Tournament Operator may apply additional filters to the VRS lists (e.g., "North America") insofar as they do not lead to the specific targeting of individual Teams or Rosters. For the avoidance of doubt, filtering by country or gender is permitted.

3.8.4 The VRS rank of the invited Rosters must be lower than 12 on the Global VRS at the time of the Invite Date.


3.9 **Wildcard Tournaments.** For every three completed Tournaments, Tournament Operator may operate one Wildcard Tournament of equivalent or lesser Tier. If Tournament Operator defines a Tournament as a Wildcard Tournament, the following rules shall apply:

### 5. Competition / Integrity.

5.1 **Non-Exclusivity**. Tournament Operator undertakes not to engage in direct or indirect agreements with Teams, Rosters, or Athletes ("Participants") that would artificially restrict their ability to take part in other Tournaments. Tournament Operator is free to restrict a Participant's participation in other Tournaments while the affected Participant is on location at a Tournament\'s LAN event and within the published date boundaries of the Tournament.

5.2 **Non-Discriminatory Treatment of Participants.** Any agreement between Tournament Operator and Participant needs to be non-discriminatory and identical for all Participants. In particular, if Tournament Operator is going to share revenue or otherwise provide financial support, then such support must be equivalent for all Participants or otherwise determined by an objective KPI that is applied equally to all Participants, including Participants that have been directly invited, qualified or entered through a Wildcard Invite determined before Participants are selected. Such support must be accessible by all Participants, determined by the Participant's performance in the Tournament or another objective merit-based KPI related to the Tournament (e.g. viewership numbers of matches involving the respective Participant or by the Roster's VRS ranking on the Invitation Date). 

5.2.1 Regardless of any agreements between Tournament Operator and Participants that pertain to compensation, all Participants of the same stage of the Tournament shall receive equal treatment in all aspects of the event. This includes but is not limited to: accommodations, allowances, venue access, privileges, practice facilities, preparation time, and technical support. Provisions for Participants must be identical in quality, duration, and availability.

5.3 **Potential Conflicts of Interest.** Tournament Operator and Tournament staff may not have any business relationship, including, but not limited to, shared management, shared ownership of entities, licensing, and loans, whether related to Valve Games or otherwise (each an "**Entanglement**") with any Participant unless approved by Valve and publicly disclosed. An Entanglement is considered approved if (a) it is disclosed to Valve in writing and (b) publicly disclosed and (c) Valve has not objected to within 90 days of the disclosure to Valve; provided that only disclosures after the Effective Date of the Agreement shall trigger the 90 days period.

Within its sole discretion, Valve reserves the right to a) require that Tournament Operator address and remove the Entanglement within a reasonable period of time, not to exceed two weeks, or b) terminate the Agreement without cost or penalty for Valve.

An explicit or implicit approval by Valve shall be valid for the duration of one year starting on the date that Valve has received disclosure, unless explicitly otherwise scoped by Valve when granting the approval. The approval period shall thereafter auto-renew by the same time it was initially granted until terminated.

5.4 **Invite Exceptions.** Tournament Operator may have rules that disqualify certain Participants from their Tournaments due to misconduct, cheating infractions, being flagged by esports bodies as a matchmaking fix risk, or other integrity or compliance issues. If the Tournament Operator wishes to disqualify any Participant, they must:

- Publish the disqualification rules as part of **Additional Information**.

- Publish the details of any disqualification decision at the time it occurs.
