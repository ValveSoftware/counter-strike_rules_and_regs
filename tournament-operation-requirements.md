## Foreword

Counter-Strike is at its best when teams compete on a level playing field and when ability is the only limit to their success. And we think that Counter-Strike should be an open sport. So below, we describe new requirements to running large-scale competitive tournaments.

Briefly, these rules limit the ability to directly invite teams to tournaments, enforce transparency in compensation, and define the types of tournaments we will consider in our official ranking system.

If you're interested in running a Counter-Strike tournament you will need a license from Valve. In many cases the Limited Game Tournament License (https://store.steampowered.com/tourney/limited_license) will cover your tournament. However, if you want to operate at a scale that exceeds the limited license, you must contact Valve to obtain a broader license.

For any questions or exception requests, contact csgoteamfeedback@valvesoftware.com, subject: "tournament operation requirements.‚Äù

## Tournament Operating Requirements

The following rules shall apply to all Counter Strike 2 Tournament(s). The version of the Tournament Operation Requirements that apply to a Tournament is [the version that was current](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/counter-strike_rules_and_regs/commits/main/tournament-operation-requirements.md) as of the Tournament's Additional Information deadline.

### 1. Definitions

1.1 **"Valve Regional Standings"** or **"VRS"** shall mean the official system for ranking the performance of Rosters published by Valve, which is published monthly and shall be the basis for Direct VRS Invites. For avoidance of doubt, the only versions relevant to this document are provided in [counter-strike_regional_standings/invitation](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/counter-strike_regional_standings/tree/main/invitation)

1.2 **"Roster"** shall be a collection of five specific Athletes, irrespective of their current or later association with a given Team organization.

1.3 **"Invited Roster(s)"** shall mean any Roster that has been invited to appear in the Tournament in accordance with the procedures defined herein.

1.4 **"Participating Roster(s)"** shall mean the five Athletes that participate in the Tournament in accordance with the procedures defined herein.

1.5 **"Direct VRS Invite"** shall mean a method of selecting Rosters from the VRS.

1.6 **"Ranked Tournament"** shall mean a Tournament for which the outcome generates data used by the Valve Regional Standings to determine the relative performance of Rosters.

1.7 **"Unranked Tournament"** shall mean a Tournament for which the outcome does not generate data used by the Valve Regional Standings to determine the relative performance of Rosters.

1.8 **"Main Stage"** shall mean the stage of a Tournament past which no Rosters enter (i.e., Rosters are only eliminated past this point).

1.9 **"Open Qualifier"** shall mean a stage of the Tournament that is open to the public.

1.10 **"Announcement Date"** shall mean the date on which a Tournament is announced to the public.

1.11 **"Invite Date"** shall be the date on which the invitations to Rosters for a given Tournament are being sent out.

1.12 **"Tournament Dates"** shall mean the entire period of the Tournament, spanning from its start date to its end date, and includes all days during which Rosters could be required to be present (e.g., for matches, media, meetings, or other Tournament-related activities).



### 2. **Rules for Unranked Tournaments.** 

If the Tournament Operator defines a Tournament as an Unranked Tournament, then the following rules shall apply:

2.1 Tournament Operator must comply with the terms of the Limited Game Tournament License ([https://store.steampowered.com/tourney/limited_license](https://store.steampowered.com/tourney/limited_license)).

2.2 Rosters may be directly invited and/or selected by any other qualifying process at the discretion of the Tournament Operator.

2.3 The total compensation (including prize pool and any other forms of compensation) for an individual Unranked Tournament may not exceed $100,000. If Tournament Operator operates more than one Unranked Tournament in a year, the total compensation for all Unranked Tournaments may not exceed $250,000.



### 3. **Rules for Ranked Tournaments**

If Tournament Operator defines a Tournament as a Ranked Tournament, then the following rules shall apply:

3.1 **License.** Tournament Operator must comply with the terms of the Limited Game Tournament License ([https://store.steampowered.com/tourney/limited_license](https://store.steampowered.com/tourney/limited_license)).


3.2 **Invites.**

3.2.1 Tournament Operator chooses the VRS list or lists, and for each list, the number of Rosters to invite and the VRS ranks from which to start the invitations.

3.2.2 Tournament Operator must invite a minimum of two Rosters from any single VRS list.

3.2.3 Tournament Operator must use the most recent version of the VRS, as of the Invite Date.

3.2.4 Tournament Operator must invite Rosters sequentially, starting with the chosen starting VRS rank.

3.2.5 Directly invited VRS Rosters may only accept an invitation for a Tournament if:

a) At least three of the Participating Roster's Athletes were on the Invited Roster on the Invite Date and will play in each event match.

b) The Participating Roster satisfies the invite criteria (e.g. regional, demographic, etc).

c) The Roster has not previously declined an invitation to the same Tournament.

3.2.6 If any Rosters cannot accept, or choose to decline the Direct VRS Invite, Tournament Operator shall proceed down the VRS in order until all announced slots to the Tournament are filled.

3.2.7 In the event that there are fewer eligible VRS rosters than the number of announced Direct VRS Invites, the Tournament Operator may supplement with Open Qualifiers.

3.2.8 For compensation determined by final standing (e.g., prize pools):

a) The compensation for a given standing cannot exceed the compensation for any higher standing ( e.g., a qualifier cannot award a prize that is greater than any main event prize).

b) The compensation for a given standing must be equivalent to the compensation for all equal standings (e.g., all prizes for identical placement in parallel matches, such as different qualifiers, must be identical).

3.3 **VRS Subdivision**

3.3.1 For every two Americas VRS invitations, Tournament Operator may subdivide VRS invitations into one North America invitation and one South America invitation.

3.3.2 Tournament Operator may subdivide Asia VRS invitations equally between Oceania, West Asia, and East Asia.

3.3.3 If Tournament Operator subdivides a VRS region in this way, Rosters must have a plurality of citizenships from the relevant subregion (among the players from the region).


3.4 **VRS Priority.**

3.4.1 If the Tournament Operator includes Wildcard Invites or Open Qualifiers, those Rosters must enter the Tournament at or before the first stage featuring a VRS invite.

3.4.2 A Directly Invited VRS Roster cannot start at a later stage than another Directly Invited VRS Roster with a higher VRS Rank.

3.4.3 Rosters without a Global VRS rank cannot be seeded higher than VRS Ranked Rosters.

3.4.4 Initial seeding will use the version of the VRS that was specified in the Additional Information announcement.


3.5 **Open Qualifiers.** 

For Open Qualifiers, Tournament Operator can use any criteria that in good faith are reasonable and transparent, and do not specifically target individual Rosters. Acceptable criteria include demographics and region (e.g. \"Female Rosters based in Canada\").


3.6 **Wildcard Invite.** 

3.6.1 For every 8 Rosters invited from a VRS, 2 eligible Rosters ("**Wildcard Invite**") can be invited to the Tournament. 

3.6.2 If Tournament Operator chooses not to make use of previously announced Wildcard invitations, they may invite the next highest ranked Rosters from the VRS lists already announced for the Tournament.

3.6.3 A Roster shall only be eligible for a Wildcard Invite if it is ranked lower than 12 on the Global VRS list and it fulfills at least one of the following requirements as of the Invitation Date:

a) It includes at least 3 players who individually were members of a top 12 Roster on an Invite VRS List at any time during the preceding 6 months.

b) It has placed first or second place in any Tournament, of equal or lesser tier than the one issuing the invite, during the preceding 6 months.


3.7 **Tier 1 Tournaments.** 

If the Tournament Operator defines the Tournament as a "Tier 1" Tournament then the following rules shall apply:

3.7.1 Tournament Operator must invite from one or more of the official VRS lists: Global, Americas, Europe, Asia.

3.7.2 The Tournament must invite a minimum of 20 Rosters by Direct VRS Invite.

3.7.4 The Main Stage must feature a minimum of 8 Rosters.

3.7.5 Tournament Operator may additionally include Open Qualifiers.


3.8 **Tier 2 Tournaments.** 

If Tournament Operator defines a Tournament as a Tier 2 Tournament, the following rules shall apply:

3.8.1 The Tournament Operator may invite entirely by one or more Open Qualifiers.

3.8.2 If the Tournament Operator invites *any* Rosters by Direct VRS Invite, then the Tournament must invite a minimum of 4 Rosters by Direct VRS Invite.

3.8.3 Tournament Operator may apply additional filters to the VRS lists (e.g., "North America") insofar as they do not lead to the specific targeting of individual Teams or Rosters. For the avoidance of doubt, filtering by country or gender is permitted.

3.8.4 The VRS rank of the invited Rosters must be lower than 12 on the Global VRS at the time of the Invite Date.


3.9 **Wildcard Tournaments.** For every three completed Tournaments, Tournament Operator may operate one Wildcard Tournament of equivalent or lesser Tier. If Tournament Operator defines a Tournament as a Wildcard Tournament, the following rules shall apply:

3.9.1 A Wildcard Tournament may feature an unlimited number of Wildcard invitations and has no minimum number of rosters participating in the Tournament.

3.9.2 Tournament Operator must specify the Tournaments associated with the Wildcard Tournament. Wildcard invitations must adhere to the same VRS list applied to the respective Tournaments.

### 5. Competition / Integrity.

5.1 **Non-Exclusivity**. Tournament Operator undertakes not to engage in direct or indirect agreements with Teams, Rosters, or Athletes ("Participants") that would artificially restrict their ability to take part in other Tournaments. Tournament Operator is free to restrict a Participant's participation in other Tournaments while the affected Participant is on location at a Tournament\'s LAN event and within the published date boundaries of the Tournament.

5.2 **Non-Discriminatory Treatment of Participants.** Any agreement between Tournament Operator and Participant needs to be non-discriminatory and identical for all Participants. In particular, if Tournament Operator is going to share revenue or otherwise provide financial support, then such support must be equivalent for all Participants or otherwise determined by an objective KPI that is applied equally to all Participants, including Participants that have been directly invited, qualified or entered through a Wildcard Invite determined before Participants are selected. Such support must be accessible by all Participants, determined by the Participant's performance in the Tournament or another objective merit-based KPI related to the Tournament (e.g. viewership numbers of matches involving the respective Participant or by the Roster's VRS ranking on the Invitation Date). 

5.2.1 Regardless of any agreements between Tournament Operator and Participants that pertain to compensation, all Participants of the same stage of the Tournament shall receive equal treatment in all aspects of the event. This includes but is not limited to: accommodations, allowances, venue access, privileges, practice facilities, preparation time, and technical support. Provisions for Participants must be identical in quality, duration, and availability.

5.3 **Potential Conflicts of Interest.** Tournament Operator and Tournament staff may not have any business relationship, including, but not limited to, shared management, shared ownership of entities, licensing, and loans, whether related to Valve Games or otherwise (each an "**Entanglement**") with any Participant unless approved by Valve and publicly disclosed. An Entanglement is considered approved if (a) it is disclosed to Valve in writing and (b) publicly disclosed and (c) Valve has not objected to within 90 days of the disclosure to Valve; provided that only disclosures after the Effective Date of the Agreement shall trigger the 90 days period.

Within its sole discretion, Valve reserves the right to a) require that Tournament Operator address and remove the Entanglement within a reasonable period of time, not to exceed two weeks, or b) terminate the Agreement without cost or penalty for Valve.

An explicit or implicit approval by Valve shall be valid for the duration of one year starting on the date that Valve has received disclosure, unless explicitly otherwise scoped by Valve when granting the approval. The approval period shall thereafter auto-renew by the same time it was initially granted until terminated.

5.4 **Invite Exceptions.** Tournament Operator may have rules that disqualify certain Participants from their Tournaments due to misconduct, cheating infractions, being flagged by esports bodies as a matchmaking fix risk, or other integrity or compliance issues. If the Tournament Operator wishes to disqualify any Participant, they must:

- Publish the disqualification rules as part of **Additional Information**.

- Publish the details of any disqualification decision at the time it occurs.
