## Tournament Exceptions

A number of events do not exactly follow our [tournament operation requirements](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/counter-strike_rules_and_regs/blob/main/tournament-operation-requirements.md). We allow events to operate outside of those requirements in some cases, provided the exceptions are known to us and explicitly approved.

The following are exceptions we have explicitly made, because they give the tournament operator some flexibility, tend to produce more sorting data than the minimum requirements of our guidelines, and most importantly, do not go against the spirit of the requirements.

If there are exceptions that we have failed to note here, or are not aware of, please let us know at csgoteamfeedback@valvesoftware.com, subject: "tournament operation exceptions.”
