# The CS Major Supplemental Rulebook

### Foreword
The goal of the Major is to bring together the best Counter-Strike players in the world to a LAN setting, provide them an opportunity to claim their title, and to demonstrate to millions of CS players around the world just how high the Counter-Strike skill ceiling is.

This document does not contain all of the rules of the tournament; only the ones we require to be uniform across all Major events. For the complete body of tournament rules for your event, contact the tournament organizer.

## Participants
*Rules and procedures for determining who is to participate in the events.*

### Invitations

The Major features 32 teams
- 16 teams are invited to Stage 1 from the Major Regional Qualifiers.
- 8 teams are invited to Stage 2 based on Valve Regional Standing.
- 8 teams are invited to Stage 3 based on Valve Regional Standing.

Invitations are allocated according to the number of teams from the region that earned their respective position in the Major:
- One Stage 2 invitation is assigned to the region for every team of that region that reached Stage 3 of the previous Major.
- One Stage 3 invitation is assigned to the region for every team of that region that reached the Playoffs of the previous Major.
  
Top teams that have not been invited to Stage 2 or Stage 3 are invited to their region's respective Major Regional Qualifier (MRQ), with the following distribution:

|    Region |     MRQ Invitations           |        Stage 1 Invitations |
| --------: | :----------------------------:|:------------------------: |
|    Europe |          Next 16 from VRS     |        6                  |
|   America |          Next 16 from VRS     |        6                  |
|      Asia |           Next 8 from VRS     |        4                  |
| **Total** |           **40**              |     **16**                |

##### Major Invites for Summer 2025 based on performance of regions in [Winter 2024](#Final-Rankings-Major):
|     Region | Stage 1 | Stage 2 | Stage 3 |
|-----------:|:-------:|:-------:|:--------|
|     Europe | 6       | 4       | 6       |
|    America | 6       | 4       | 1       |
|       Asia | 4       | -       | 1       |
| **Totals** | **16**  | **8**   | **8**   |


### Regional Standing
Teams in each world region are sorted via Valve Regional Standing (VRS). The three VRS regions are EU, Americas, and Asia, and these three lists are used for the purposes of invitation. A global version of the VRS is used only for the [pre-event seeding](#Pre-event-Seeding) of stages, after invitations have been accepted.

If a team is invited to participate in a stage of the event based on their Regional Standing, at least three out of the five members of the core roster (the five players indicated in the Regional Standing) must accept the invitation, otherwise the invitation will be extended to the next-highest ranked roster in the region.

<a id="regional-assignments"></a>
#### Team Regional Assignment
A team’s region is determined by the region of the VRS from which they have been invited.

#### Invitation Process
Invitations will be sent to intact teams, per the [invitation](#Invitations) requirements above. 

Invitations are first sent to teams invited to participate in Stage 3. Then invitations are sent to teams invited to Stage 2. Finally, invitations are sent to teams invited to the MRQs.

If a team declines an invitation, or is no longer intact, they do not participate in the Major and the next-highest ranked team receives their invitation. If there are no additional teams available, then the remaining slots are to be determined by a last-chance regional qualifier.

In the event that a team would be invited to a particular stage based on more than one regional VRS, they are considered to have been invited based on the region with greater representation in the Major (i.e., Europe, then America, then Asia).

### Team Rosters
#### Team Requirements
- Team roster must include 5 players ("Core Lineup").
- Team roster may optionally include 1 coach.
- Team roster may optionally include 1 substitute player that, were they to replace any core player, would not alter the [Regional Assignment](#regional-assignments) of the Core Lineup.
- The coach and substitute may be the same person.

A team cannot adjust their Core Lineup between the MRQ and the Major. However, they can register a different coach or substitute player.

#### Participant Manifest
The TO needs to collect the following of all registered participants and [deliver them to Valve](#Deliverables) (Excel or CSV). 

- Team 
- Position (player, sub, or coach)
- Full name
- Nickname
- Date of birth
- Country of citizenship
- Email
- SteamID
- Steam Workshop autograph item link

*The TO must inform participants that this information will be transferred to Valve.*

### Player/Team Info
#### Player Nicknames
New players' nicknames are to be registered and represented as they are commonly known in third party esports media (e.g., hltv and liquipedia). Players that have previously registered for a Major event and are using the same Steam account are to use their previously registered nicknames.

#### Team Names and Logos
Team names and logos are to be registered and represented as they are commonly seen in their own media and in third party esports media. 

If there are multiple teams whose commonly known names share the same title sponsors, only one of them may use the title sponsor at the event.

#### Agreement 
Players and teams are required to accept the following agreement (verbatim) in order to participate in the event. The TO will distribute (physically or digitally) and collect signatures or equivalent from all registered participants and team representatives and [deliver them to Valve](#Deliverables). The acceptance must be legally binding (e.g., valid signatures).

<a id="seeding"></a>
### Seeding
<a id="Pre-event-Seeding"></a>
#### Pre-event Seeding
Coming into the event, all 32 teams are sorted based on their current global standing in the [VRS](#Regional-Standing).

#### Stage Seeding
* Stage 1: 
	* All teams will use their [pre-event seed](#Pre-event-Seeding).

* Stage 2: 
	* The teams directly invited to this stage will be seeds 1-8, and use their [pre-event seed](#Pre-event-Seeding).
	* The advancing 8 teams will be seeds 9-16 and use their final seed from the previous stage (see [Mid-stage Seed Calculation](#Mid-Stage-Seed-Calculation)).

* Stage 3: 
	* The teams directly invited to this stage will be seeds 1-8, and use their [pre-event seed](#Pre-event-Seeding).
	* The advancing 8 teams will be seeds 9-16 and use their final seed from the previous stage (see [Mid-stage Seed Calculation](#Mid-Stage-Seed-Calculation)).

* Playoffs:
	* All teams will use their final seed from Stage 3 (see [Mid-stage Seed Calculation](#Mid-stage-Seed-Calculation)).

##### Mid-stage Seed Calculation
For all Swiss match-ups, after the initial matches, seed is determined (in order) by:
1. Current W-L record in the stage
2. [Difficulty Score](#Difficulty-score) in the current stage
3. Initial seeding of the current stage

##### Difficulty Score (Buchholz)
Each team's Difficulty Score is tracked for the purpose of tie-breaking. 

The Difficulty Score is the sum of current wins minus the sum of current losses for every opponent a team has faced.

###### Example:
*Team A's prior opponents are 2-0 and 1-1. Team A's Difficulty Score is 2 (prior opponents have 3 wins total, and 1 loss total, so 3-1 = 2)*

*Team B's prior opponents are both 1-1. Their Difficulty Score is 0 (prior opponents have 2 wins and 2 losses in total, so 2-2 = 0)*

*Therefore, if both Team A and B have the same win-loss record, Team A gets the higher seed because it played against teams that were more difficult to defeat.*

## Technical Specifications
*Requirements that pertain to the technical setup, configuration, and execution of the MRQs and Majors.*

### Maps
The TO is to use the up-to-date in-game versions of the maps in the Active Duty Map Group.

#### Workshop maps
Players can have workshop maps on their competition machines provided that
1. The workshop map was downloaded directly from the workshop by an event admin.
1. The workshop map has a minimum of 100k (one hundred thousand) subscribers.
1. The game is restarted in the presence of an admin before the competition match begin.
 
#### Modifications/Restrictions
- Game art and sound are not to be modified on player or observer clients.
- Augmented reality (AR) elements are not to be designed to pretend to be a part of the game world.
- Augmented reality (AR) elements are to only ever present useful information (e.g. player statistics).
- Any sponsorship in AR attached to the above needs written approval by Valve. 
- Players' access to their inventory should not be modified or augmented.

### Anti-tampering
#### Network Restrictions
Competition PCs are to have no internet access aside from what is minimally required to log in to Steam and CS and run the game.

- Block access to everything and allow only UDP traffic to AS32590 blocks (http://bgp.he.net/AS32590#_prefixes) to avoid any content hosted on 3rd party sites from getting onto the tournament machines. Blocking all non-UDP traffic, primarily TCP access, even to our AS32590 blocks is also required, because our IP ranges still deliver game content, and malicious participants can have game content masquerading as different appid on Steam Greenlight, Early Access, or the Workshop.

- Have the tournament LAN ports 27015-27050 open for TCP and UDP to Valve network AS. This will just allow WebSocket connections to be used for logon traffic.

- Ideal implementation will be proactively dropping non-UDP connections with TCP resets or similar low-level packets sent to initiating clients, which should hopefully help the client timeouts to be reasonable (as opposed to blackholing outgoing traffic and forcing the client to be stuck waiting for prolonged periods of time).

- Set the player machines to use local host (127.0.0.1) for DNS, otherwise players will experience stalls while trying to reach an external DNS due to the network restrictions.

#### PC Restrictions
Competition PCs are to be secured and managed by event staff and restricted down to what is minimally required to log in and run the game.

- Provide each player a unique SSD that remains in the possession of the TO and only used by players while supervised.
- The SSD image must be created using a Steam account with access to all game depots including Chinese audio localization files by Perfect World and other Perfect World assets that are required for players using their Steam accounts linked to Perfect World accounts. 
	- **Let us know the Steam account you will be using to author the SSD images** and we will add correct licenses to your Steam account so that you could download all the required assets. Without the correct licenses some players will be unable to launch the game because network restrictions will be blocking downloads of missing assets.
- Create non-admin Windows account for players and do not distribute admin credentials or access.
- Set the entire Steam folder to Read-Only access with the exception of the \Steam\logs\ folder which will need write access to update the log files.
- Create a directory “C:\configs” on each machine and define a system global environment variable USRLOCALCSGO with the value of that directory “C:\configs” (or if each player has their own Windows account that environment variable can have path pointing at player’s roaming profile subdirectory). Players can copy their config.cfg into C:\configs and the game will load and save configs there so you won’t need administrator rights for players to change configs, and Steam CS install can remain read-only.
- Collect a list of required peripheral drivers from players and download them directly from the manufacturer.
- USB mass storage devices and similar devices should be disabled using the following instructions:
	- Start > Run > gpedit.msc
	- Local Computer Policy > Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > System > Removable Storage Access
	- Enable the deny rules for all of the entries except for Custom Classes.
- Setup disk auditing so you can see all changes made to the disk by the player 
- Setup AppLocker
	1. Application Identity Service (AppIDSvc) must be started for AppLocker to work properly. Recommend setting it to automatic.
	1. Go to Applocker and create default rules then delete the allow program files rule.
	1. Set allow rules for the following (can be set for the everyone group or the Windows user players will be using):
		- Steam.exe
		- csgo.exe
		- any other applications players will need access to such as VOIP (note that these applications may be blocked from making config file changes on the limited Windows user account so prepare the configs ahead of time from the admin account)
	1. Set Deny rules for the following (can be set for the everyone group or the Windows user players will be using):
		- powershell.exe
		- cmd.exe
		- cscript.exe
- In the BIOS set a password then enable Secure Boot, set boot to UEFI only, remove all boot devices other than the OS drive (specifically make sure USB boot is not an option), and enable VT-d if the hardware supports it.

##### Windows Auditing
Setting up auditing rules should be done on player machines so if a player is called into question there are records of actions taken on the machine. It should be noted that on some hardware this could potentially cause performance issues so once auditing rules have been set the machines should be tested and benchmarked to ensure that the game will still run smoothly.

- Enter the following commands into an elevated command prompt:
	- auditpol /set /user:proplayer /category:* /success:enable
	- auditpol /set /user:proplayer /category:* /failure:enable

	_NOTE: Make sure the /user:proplayer is changed to reflect the account name the players will be using._

	- The clock on player machines should also be set to synchronize with an internet time server to ensure the time stamp on the events is accurate.

### Client Settings
#### Convars
Clients should have the following convars set as such:
```
cl_invites_only_mainmenu 1
cl_invites_only_friends 1
```

### Server Settings
#### Server Mods
- Server may run [eBot](https://github.com/deStrO/eBot-CSGO). 
- For any other server mod, the TO will obtain approval in writing from Valve.

#### Demos
- Confirm that server is recording demos. Demos are to be [delivered to Valve.](#Deliverables)

#### Convars
All server convars are to be set to Premier defaults (by first loading cfg/gamemode_competitive.cfg and then loading cfg/gamemode_competitive_tmm.cfg) except for the following exceptions.

- The following convars are to be set as such:
```
tv_enable                                              1

#### Match Log Setup [Major]
Servers must be configured to submit logs in order for the match results to present in the client to all users. 

1. Provide Valve the Steam ID of the account ("Admin") that will be setting and submitting the match logs in order to enable the Control Room.
1. Provide Valve a Web API key for the Admin account. If you don't have one, create one [here.](https://steamcommunity.com/dev)

<a id="CSTV"></a>
#### CSTV [Major]
##### Pre-event CSTV Testing
Below is a step-by-step test to confirm that GOTV and caster camera/audio are working correctly.

1. Get a vanilla CS game server install using SteamCMD >> app_update 730 validate.

1. Create your game server login token for CS AppID 730 at: https://steamcommunity.com/dev/managegameservers

1. Launch the game server using bash on Linux 
`./cs2 -dedicated -debug -console +game_type 0 +game_mode 1 +mapgroup mg_dust247 +map de_dust2 +sv_setsteamaccount TOKEN_FROM_PREV_STEP +tv_enable 1 -ip 10.10.10.12`

1. On the game server enable CSTV camera man SteamID (and optionally set a shorter TV delay for testing):
    ``` 
    sv_spec_hear 4
    tv_delay 7
    tv_allow_camera_man_steamid STEAM_ID_OF_OBSERVER
    (optionally start CSTV broadcast upload)
    ```
1. Connect players to the game server:
    * one player connect CT (connect XX.XX.XX.XX:27015)
    * tester connect to the CSTV port (connect XX.XX.XX.XX:27020) or start watching playcast 

1. Run the game on observer computer with -interactivecaster launch option
1. Connect observer's game to the server as spectator (connect XX.XX.XX.XX:27015, then press 'M' to switch to spectator, will appear on the scoreboard as 'SPEC')
    * Note that the game server will print the following line when your cameraman connects:
    `Adding ID:XXXXXXXX to active caster list!`
1. Verify on the game server that players are connected as expected:
    `status`
    ```
    map     : de_dust2
    gotv[0]:  port 27020, delay 7.0s, rate 32.0
    userid name uniqueid connected ping loss state rate adr
    2 1 "Player1" STEAM_1:1:XXXXXXX 11:35 14 0 active 786432 X.X.X.X:27005
    7 "GOTV" BOT active 32
    10 3 "Player2" STEAM_1:0:XXXXXXX 07:11 17 0 active 786432 X.X.X.X:27005
    ```

    `tv_status`
    
    ```
    --- GOTV[0] Status ---
    Online 11:01, FPS 128.0, Version 8378 (Linux)
    Master "GOTV", delay 7, rate 32.0
    Game Time 10:54, Mod "csgo", Map "de_dust2", Players 2
    Local Slots 128, Spectators 1, Proxies 0
    userid name uniqueid connected ping loss state rate adr
     2 1 "Viewer1" STEAM_1:1:3 07:37 35 0 active 196608 X.X.X.X:27005
    ```
    
1. GOTV viewer should enable caster camera control and caster voice via scoreboard
1. Observer should start switching camera and narrating the action
1. GOTV viewer in our test sees camera switching and caster's in-game voice narration matching the camerawork

## Regulations
*Rules and procedures that pertain to the active administration of the tournaments.*

### Substitutions
Each team can substitute a player with their registered substitute once during the event.

- A team may make a substitution *in-between matches* for any reason. 
- A team may make a substitution *during a match or in-between maps* only in the case of a medical emergency.
- Once a substitution has been made, the team can continue to play with the substitute player until they choose to revert to their Core Lineup.
- The substitution rules above apply if a team chooses to revert to their Core Lineup.
- Once the team reverts to the Core Lineup, it may not substitute again for any reason and must play shorthanded or forfeit if the situation arises.

### Stage Integrity
#### Equipment
The TO will prevent players from bringing any electronics (e.g., pagers, cell phones, etc.) aside from permitted gaming peripherals (mouse, keyboard, etc) to the competition area by employing a metal detector security detail at the entrance.

Any other items players wish to bring on stage must be inspected by the TO staff. 

#### Team staff restrictions
Aside from the TO staff, only the five players and the team's pre-registered coach are permitted in the competition area during event matches.

Coaches are not to communicate with (i.e., be seen, heard, or felt by) the players by any means at any time with the exception of warmup, half-time, and tactical timeouts. 

Coaches that wish to call a timeout are to do so by notifying an admin.

In the case of any matches where event admins are not physically present (e.g. online matches), no team staff, including the coach, may be physically or virtually present or communicate with the players at any time during the match.

### Match Log Submissions [Major]
Servers must be configured to submit logs and data is to be entered for each match. 

#### Match Log Setup
1. Provide Valve the Steam ID of the account ("Admin") that will be setting and submitting the match logs in order to enable the Control Room.
1. Provide Valve a Web API key for the Admin account. If you don't have one, create one [here.](https://steamcommunity.com/dev)

#### Before Each Match
1. Launch CS from the Admin account, click on Watch, and then click on Control Room button. 
1. Fill out the stage, teams and map for the match about to be played. We suggest formatting the match password as follows: ```teamname1-vs-teamname2-stage-1-of-3-map```
1. On the server the match is to be played on, set the following convars.
```
log on
mp_teamname_1 <Team Name 1>
mp_teamname_2 <Team Name 2>
logaddress_token_secret <match password>
logaddress_add_http <Valve supplied URL>
```

#### After Each Match
Return to the Control Room and click the `SAVE FINAL SCORE` button. This will close out the match in the game for all users and allow them to claim souvenirs.
