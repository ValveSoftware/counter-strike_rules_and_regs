# The CS Supplemental Rulebook

### Foreword
The goal of the Major is to bring together the best Counter-Strike players in the world to a LAN setting, provide them an opportunity to claim their title, and to demonstrate to millions of CS players around the world just how high the Counter-Strike skill ceiling is.

The Major represents the pinnacle of Counter-Strike skill and provides an open invitation for the best in the world to participate regardless of their means or access.

Historically, the rules and requirements for Majors have been communicated publicly through different channels or to partners privately. By consolidating them into a single document, we hope to eliminate inconsistencies across Valve-sponsored events and allow tournament operators to prepare their staff well in advance of their events.

This document does not contain all of the rules of the tournament; only the ones we require to be uniform across all Major events. For the complete body of tournament rules for your event, contact the tournament organizer.

If you would like to contact the CS team with questions or comments, feel free to send an email to csgoteamfeedback [at] valvesoftware.com, with the subject #MajorsRule.

## Tournament Organizer Obligations
*What is expected of tournament organizers with respect to this document.*

### Publication
The Tournament Organizer ("TO") will include this document in its tournament rules. Event admins are expected to be familiar with the contents. Any conflict between these and other tournament rules are to be resolved prior to the publication of the event rules.

### Deliverables
These are the main deliverables outlined in this document that are required of the TO, along with their due date (relative to the start of the event).

## Participants
*Rules and procedures for determining who is to participate in the events.*

### Invitations
#### Invitations [MAJOR]
Major invites are sent to the core lineup (not including a substitute) who earned an invitation from the most recent RMR.

A team cannot adjust their core lineup between the RMR and the Major. However, they can register a different coach or substitute player.

The Major features 24 teams
- 16 teams are invited to enter the Major in the Opening stage.
- 8 teams receive Opening Stage byes and are invited directly to the Elimination stage.

#### Invitations [RMR]
Half of a region's RMR teams will be directly invited via Regional Standings. The remaining positions will be filled via closed qualifiers. The date of the Regional Standings used for invitations will be communicated in advance by the TO.

#### World Regions
Separating world-wide competition into regions that allow players to compete with low latency is important to measure skill on a level playing field.

Regional Major Ranking events (RMRs) sort teams within their region, and the top teams from each region receive Major invitations.

RMR regions roughly correspond to their geographic equivalent. On the edges, countries should be assigned to the region that provides teams the lowest latency in qualifiers.

The 3 RMR regions are
- Europe
- America
- Asia

In the event that the RMRs must be held online, there will be 5 RMR regions
- Europe
- North America
- South America
- Asia
- Oceania

### Regional Standing
Teams in each World Region are sorted via an official Regional Standing. 

If a team is invited to participate in a stage of the event based on their Regional Standing, at least three out of the five members of the core roster (the five players indicated in the Regional Standing) must accept the invitation, otherwise the invitation will be extended to the next-highest rated roster in the region.

#### Team Regional Assignment
A team’s region is determined by the citizenship of the majority of its players. In case of a tie, the team chooses between the two.
In the case of players that don't belong to one of the 3 regions (Europe, Asia, Americas), those players can assign themselves to a region already represented on the roster.
If all players are from another region, then they can choose any region.

#### Regional Representation
The number of teams invited from each region depends on the performance of that region in the preceding Major. Opening and Elimination Stage invitations are allocated according to the number of teams from the region that earned their respective position in the Major:
- One Opening stage invitation is assigned to the region for every team of that region that reached the Elimination stage of the previous Major.
- One Elimination stage invitation is assigned to the region for every team of that region that reached the Playoff stage of the previous Major.

Additionally, 8 Opening stage invitations are distributed to regions.

|     Region | Additional Opening Stage Invitations |
|-----------:|:----------:|
|     Europe | 3          |
|    America | 3          |
|       Asia | 2          |
| **Total** | **8**      |

Note that for the purposes of RMR, regions represented by more than 8 teams will be subdivided into groups of 8 or less, so that each group can be resolved with one of the available [RMR formats](#format_rmr).

#### Invitation Process
Invitations will be sent to intact teams, per the [invitation](#Invitations) requirements above. 

If a team declines an invitation, or is no longer intact, the next-highest ranked team receives their invitation. If there are no additional teams available, then the remaining slots are to be determined by a last-chance regional qualifier.

### Team Rosters
#### Team Requirements
- Team roster must include 5 players ("Core Lineup").
- Team roster may optionally include 1 coach.
- Team roster may optionally include 1 substitute player.
- The coach and substitute may be the same person.

#### Participant Manifest
The TO needs to collect the following of all registered participants and [deliver them to Valve](#Deliverables) (Excel or CSV).

## Format
*Rules, procedures, and definitions that pertain to the format and structure of the competition.*

<a id="Structure"></a>

### Format [Major]

1. Opening Stage
    - Swiss bracket 
    - 16 Teams
1. Elimination Stage
    - Swiss bracket 
    - 16 Teams
1. Playoffs Stage
    - Single elimination bracket
    - Top 8 from the Elimination Stage

<a id="format_rmr"></a>
### Format [RMR]
The RMR format for a region is determined by the number of slots for that region. All teams not directly invited due to RMR position are to qualify in through [closed qualifiers](#format_closed). The formats are as follows:

- 1-4 invites: 8-team double-elimination bracket
	
	Best of 3: Decider matches.

- 5 to 8 invites: 16 team [Swiss bracket](#Swiss-Bracket)
	
	Best of 3: Decider matches (e.g., matches where a team reaches their third win or third loss).
	
	At times, it will be necessary to determine Opening or Elimination Stage invitations among a group of teams with identical records. In that case the following process should be used to separate them:
	
		1 team: one of the two 3-0 teams.
		- The two 3-0 teams play a best of 3 and the loser is eliminated.

		2 teams: both 3-0 teams.
		
		3 teams: both 3-0 teams and one of the three 3-1 teams.
		- The three 3-1 teams are first sorted by difficulty score. 
		- The lower two teams play a best of 3 and the loser is eliminated. 
		- The remaining two teams play a best of 3 and the loser is eliminated.

		4 teams: both 3-0 teams and two of the three 3-1 teams.
		- The three 3-1 teams are first sorted by difficulty score. 
		- The lower two teams play a best of 3 and the loser is eliminated. 	
		
		5 teams: both 3-0 teams and all three 3-1 teams.
		
		6 teams: both 3-0 teams, all three 3-1 teams, and one of the three 3-2 team. 
		- The three 3-2 teams are first sorted by difficulty score. 
		- The lower two teams play a best of 3 and the loser is eliminated. 
		- The remaining two teams play a best of 3 and the loser is eliminated.
	
		7 teams: both 3-0 teams, all three 3-1 teams, and two of the three 3-2 teams.
		- The three 3-2 teams are first sorted by difficulty score. 
		- The lower two teams play a best of 3 and the loser is eliminated. 

		8 teams: both 3-0, all three 3-1, and all three 3-2 teams.

- 9 to 16 invites: subdivide teams by [Final Ranking](#Final-Rankings-Major), placing teams into two groups. The resulting groups are to use the format appropriate for that number of invites, per the above.

- 17 to 21 invites: subdivide teams by [Final Ranking](#Final-Rankings-Major), placing teams into two groups. The groups each play a 16 team [Swiss bracket](#Swiss-Bracket) with 8 teams advancing. Teams with a 2-3 record play in a last-chance single-elimination Bo3 bracket, with teams from group 1 playing initial matchups against teams from group 2 following the Swiss matchup rules. After initial matchups, the subsequent format depends on the number of invites:

		17 teams:
		- The three remaining 3-3 teams are first sorted by difficulty score. 
		- The lower two teams play a best of 3 and the loser is eliminated. 
		- The remaining two teams play a best of 3 and the loser is eliminated.

		18 teams:
		- The three remaining 3-3 teams are first sorted by difficulty score. 
		- The lower two teams play a best of 3 and the loser is eliminated. 	
		
		19 teams: all three remaining 3-3 teams.

		20 teams:
		- The three 3-3 teams advance.
		- The three remaining 2-4 teams are first sorted by difficulty score.
		- The upper two teams play a best of 3 and the winner advances.

		21 teams:
		- The three 3-3 teams advance.
		- The three remaining 2-4 teams are first sorted by difficulty score.
		- The upper two teams play a best of 3 and the winner advances.
		- The remaining two teams play a best of 3 and the winner advances.
    

#### Step 1: Assign Slots to Groups
In order to ensure that the resulting groups are as similar in strength as possible, the highest and lowest ranked invitation slots are paired and placed into a group, and this process continues for each subsequent group.
 
E.g., given 16 EUR regional slots, pair slots according to the rule above and split into two groups: 
| EUR 1    | EUR 2    |
|----------|----------|
| 1 and 16 | 2 and 15 |
| 3 and 14 | 4 and 13 |
| 5 and 12 | 6 and 11 |
| 7 and 10 | 8 and 9  |


The resulting groups are:

| EUR 1               | EUR 2               |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| 1                   | 2                   |
| 3                   | 4                   |
| 5                   | 6                   |
| 7                   | 8                   |
| 10                  | 9                   |
| 12                  | 11                  |
| 14                  | 13                  |
| 16                  | 15                  |
| Avg. Strength = 8.5 | Avg. Strength = 8.5 |

#### Step 2: Assign Qualifying Teams to Groups
All Invited and Qualified Teams are first sorted by [Regional Standing](#Regional-Standing), and then assigned to their corresponding RMR (e.g., the highest-ranked EUR team is assigned to slot 1 in the EUR 1 RMR). If the time between the Closed Qualifiers and RMR is more than a month, an updated Regional Standing will be provided prior to the start of the RMR (the date of these standings will be announced in advance by the TO). Within each RMR, the highest-ranked teams are paired with the lowest-ranked teams.     

E.g., With two 16-team RMRs, the EUR regional teams would be assigned as follows: 

|     EUR 1 |     EUR 2 |
|----------:|----------:|
| 1  and 32 | 2  and 31 |
| 3  and 30 | 4  and 29 |
| 5  and 28 | 6  and 27 |
| 7  and 26 | 8  and 25 |
| 10 and 24 | 9  and 23 |
| 12 and 22 | 11 and 21 |
| 14 and 20 | 13 and 19 |
| 16 and 18 | 15 and 17 |

##### Swiss Bracket
- Teams play against opponents of identical W-L record.
- Three wins advance---Three losses eliminate
- All elimination and advancement matches are to be best of three.
- All other matches are to be best of one.
- Teams are not to play the same opponent twice in the same stage, if possible.
- Matchups shall be determined by [seed](#seeding). The first round follows the [Initial Matchups](#Initial-Matchups). In round 2 and 3, the highest seeded team faces the lowest seeded team available that does not result in a rematch within the stage. In the case that the final matchup assigned is a rematch, the final two high seed matchup teams swap opponents. In other rounds, refer to the following table and select the top-most row that does not result in a rematch:

| Priority |  |  |  |
|:--------:|--------:|--------:|--------:|
|1         | 1v6    |2v5    |3v4    |
|2         | 1v6    |2v4    |3v5    |
|3         | 1v5    |2v6    |3v4    |
|4         | 1v5    |2v4    |3v6    |
|5         | 1v4    |2v6    |3v5    |
|6         | 1v4    |2v5    |3v6    |
|7         | 1v6    |2v3    |4v5    |
|8         | 1v5    |2v3    |4v6    |
|9         | 1v3    |2v6    |4v5    |
|10        | 1v3    |2v5    |4v6    |
|11        | 1v4    |2v3    |5v6    |
|12        | 1v3    |2v4    |5v6    |
|13        | 1v2    |3v6    |4v5    |
|14        | 1v2    |3v5    |4v6    |
|15        | 1v2    |3v4    |5v6    |

#### Best of 1 Pick-Ban Process
1. The higher seed team chooses to be Team A or Team B
1. Team A removes 2 maps
1. Team B removes 3 maps
1. Team A removes 1 map
1. Team B chooses starting side

#### Best of 3 Pick/Ban Process
1. The higher seed team chooses to be Team A or Team B
1. Team A removes 1 map
1. Team B removes 1 map
1. Team A picks the map 1
1. Team B chooses starting side on map 1
1. Team B picks map 2
1. Team A chooses starting side on map 2
1. Team B removes one map
1. Team A removes one map
1. Team B chooses starting side on map 3

<a id="format_closed"></a>
### Format [Closed Qualifier]
All teams not directly invited to an RMR will qualify via closed qualifier. The closed qualifier requirements are as follows:
- Each region will hold one closed qualifier
  - The closed qualifier may be held online.
  - If a region must be subdivided to accommodate ping of participating teams (e.g., AMER -> NA and SA), RMR invitations will be split evenly among the regions. If invitations cannot be evenly split, the remaining invitation(s) will be granted to the subdivided qualifier featuring the team with the highest Regional Standing.
- The closed qualifier format will follow the RMR format for the corresponding number of teams.
- All teams in the closed qualifier will be invited directly based on their [Regional Standing](#Regional-Standing). If it is not practical to fill all closed qualifier positions via Regional Standings, the TO may supplement with open qualifiers.
- The date of the Regional Standings used for the purpose of invitations will be announced in advance by the TO.

<a id="seeding"></a>
### Seeding
<a id="Pre-event-Seeding"></a>
#### Pre-event Seeding
Coming into the event, all 24 teams are sorted based on their current [Regional Standing](#Regional-Standing), and assigned to a slot corresponding to the [Next Major Slot](#Final-Rankings-Major).

#### Stage Seeding
* Opening Stage: 
	* All teams will use their [pre-event seed](#Pre-event-Seeding).

* Elimination Stage: 
	* The top 8 teams will use their [pre-event seed](#Pre-event-Seeding).
	* The bottom 8 teams will use their final seed from the Opening stage (see [Mid-stage Seed Calculation](#Mid-Stage-Seed-Calculation)).

* Playoff Stage:
	* All teams will use their final seed from the Elimination stage (see [Mid-stage Seed Calculation](#Mid-stage-Seed-Calculation)).

##### Mid-stage Seed Calculation
For all Swiss matchups (e.g., the Opening and Elimination stage, and Swiss RMR formats), after the initial matches, seed is determined (in order) by:
1. Current W-L record in the stage
1. [Difficulty Score](#Difficulty-score) in the current stage
1. Initial seeding of the current stage

##### Difficulty Score (Buchholz)
Each team's Difficulty Score is tracked for the purpose of tie-breaking. 

The Difficulty Score is the sum of current wins minus the sum of current losses for every opponent a team has faced.

###### Example:
*Team A's prior opponents are 2-0 and 1-1. Team A's Difficulty Score is 2 (prior opponents have 3 wins total, and 1 loss total, so 3-1 = 2)*

*Team B's prior opponents are both 1-1. Their Difficulty Score is 0 (prior opponents have 2 wins and 2 losses in total, so 2-2 = 0)*

*Therefore, if both Team A and B have the same win-loss record, Team A gets the higher seed because it played against teams that were more difficult to defeat.*

## Technical Specifications
*Requirements that pertain to the technical setup, configuration, and execution of the RMRs and Majors.*

### Maps
The TO is to use the up-to-date in-game versions of the maps in the Active Duty Map Group.

#### Workshop maps
Players can have workshop maps on their competition machines provided that
1. The workshop map was downloaded directly from the workshop by an event admin.
1. The workshop map has a minimum of 100k (one hundred thousand) subscribers.
1. The game is restarted in the presence of an admin before the competition match begin.
 
#### Modifications/Restrictions
- Game art and sound are not to be modified on player or observer clients.
- Augmented reality (AR) elements are not to be designed to pretend to be a part of the game world.
- Augmented reality (AR) elements are to only ever present useful information (e.g. player statistics).
- Any sponsorship in AR attached to the above needs written approval by Valve. 
- Players' access to their inventory should not be modified or augmented.

### Anti-tampering
#### Network Restrictions
Competition PCs are to have no internet access aside from what is minimally required to log in to Steam and CS and run the game.

- Block access to everything and allow only UDP traffic to AS32590 blocks (http://bgp.he.net/AS32590#_prefixes) to avoid any content hosted on 3rd party sites from getting onto the tournament machines. Blocking all non-UDP traffic, primarily TCP access, even to our AS32590 blocks is also required, because our IP ranges still deliver game content, and malicious participants can have game content masquerading as different appid on Steam Greenlight, Early Access, or the Workshop.

- Have the tournament LAN ports 27015-27050 open for TCP and UDP to Valve network AS. This will just allow WebSocket connections to be used for logon traffic.

- Ideal implementation will be proactively dropping non-UDP connections with TCP resets or similar low-level packets sent to initiating clients, which should hopefully help the client timeouts to be reasonable (as opposed to blackholing outgoing traffic and forcing the client to be stuck waiting for prolonged periods of time).

- Set the player machines to use local host (127.0.0.1) for DNS, otherwise players will experience stalls while trying to reach an external DNS due to the network restrictions.

#### PC Restrictions
Competition PCs are to be secured and managed by event staff and restricted down to what is minimally required to log in and run the game.

- Provide each player a unique SSD that remains in the possession of the TO and only used by players while supervised.
- The SSD image must be created using a Steam account with access to all game depots including Chinese audio localization files by Perfect World and other Perfect World assets that are required for players using their Steam accounts linked to Perfect World accounts. 
	- **Let us know the Steam account you will be using to author the SSD images** and we will add correct licenses to your Steam account so that you could download all the required assets. Without the correct licenses some players will be unable to launch the game because network restrictions will be blocking downloads of missing assets.
- Create non-admin Windows account for players and do not distribute admin credentials or access.
- Set the entire Steam folder to Read-Only access with the exception of the \Steam\logs\ folder which will need write access to update the log files.
- Create a directory “C:\configs” on each machine and define a system global environment variable USRLOCALCSGO with the value of that directory “C:\configs” (or if each player has their own Windows account that environment variable can have path pointing at player’s roaming profile subdirectory). Players can copy their config.cfg into C:\configs and the game will load and save configs there so you won’t need administrator rights for players to change configs, and Steam CS install can remain read-only.
- Collect a list of required peripheral drivers from players and download them directly from the manufacturer.
- USB mass storage devices and similar devices should be disabled using the following instructions:
	- Start > Run > gpedit.msc
	- Local Computer Policy > Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > System > Removable Storage Access
	- Enable the deny rules for all of the entries except for Custom Classes.
- Setup disk auditing so you can see all changes made to the disk by the player 
- Setup AppLocker
	1. Application Identity Service (AppIDSvc) must be started for AppLocker to work properly. Recommend setting it to automatic.
	1. Go to Applocker and create default rules then delete the allow program files rule.
	1. Set allow rules for the following (can be set for the everyone group or the Windows user players will be using):
		- Steam.exe
		- csgo.exe
		- any other applications players will need access to such as VOIP (note that these applications may be blocked from making config file changes on the limited Windows user account so prepare the configs ahead of time from the admin account)
	1. Set Deny rules for the following (can be set for the everyone group or the Windows user players will be using):
		- powershell.exe
		- cmd.exe
		- cscript.exe
- In the BIOS set a password then enable Secure Boot, set boot to UEFI only, remove all boot devices other than the OS drive (specifically make sure USB boot is not an option), and enable VT-d if the hardware supports it.

##### Windows Auditing
Setting up auditing rules should be done on player machines so if a player is called into question there are records of actions taken on the machine. It should be noted that on some hardware this could potentially cause performance issues so once auditing rules have been set the machines should be tested and benchmarked to ensure that the game will still run smoothly.

- Enter the following commands into an elevated command prompt:
	- auditpol /set /user:proplayer /category:* /success:enable
	- auditpol /set /user:proplayer /category:* /failure:enable

	_NOTE: Make sure the /user:proplayer is changed to reflect the account name the players will be using._

	- The clock on player machines should also be set to synchronize with an internet time server to ensure the time stamp on the events is accurate.

### Client Settings
#### Convars
Clients should have the following convars set as such:
```
cl_invites_only_mainmenu 1
cl_invites_only_friends 1
```

### Server Settings
#### Server Mods
- Server may run [eBot](https://github.com/deStrO/eBot-CSGO). 
- For any other server mod, the TO will obtain approval in writing from Valve.

#### Demos
- Confirm that server is recording demos. Demos are to be [delivered to Valve.](#Deliverables)

#### Convars
All server convars are to be set to Premier defaults (by first loading cfg/gamemode_competitive.cfg and then loading cfg/gamemode_competitive_tmm.cfg) except for the following exceptions.

- The following convars are to be set as such:

#### Match Log Setup [Major]
Servers must be configured to submit logs in order for the match results to present in the client to all users. 

1. Provide Valve the Steam ID of the account ("Admin") that will be setting and submitting the match logs in order to enable the Control Room.
1. Provide Valve a Web API key for the Admin account. If you don't have one, create one [here.](https://steamcommunity.com/dev)

<a id="GOTV"></a>
#### GOTV [Major]
##### Pre-event GOTV Testing
Below is a step-by-step test to confirm that GOTV and caster camera/audio are working correctly.

1. Get a vanilla CS game server install using SteamCMD >> app_update 740 validate.

1. Create your game server login token for CS AppID 730 at: https://steamcommunity.com/dev/managegameservers

1. Launch the game server using bash on Linux 
`./srcds_run -debug -game csgo -console +game_type 0 +game_mode 1 +mapgroup mg_dust247 +map de_dust2 -tickrate 128 +sv_setsteamaccount TOKEN_FROM_PREV_STEP +tv_enable 1 -ip 10.10.10.12`

1. On the game server enable GOTV camera man SteamID (and optionally set a shorter TV delay for testing):
    ``` 
    sv_spec_hear 4
    tv_delay 7
    tv_allow_camera_man_steamid STEAM_ID_OF_OBSERVER
    (optionally start GOTV+ broadcast upload)
    ```
1. Connect players to the game server:
    * one player connect CT (connect XX.XX.XX.XX:27015)
    * tester connect to the GOTV port (connect XX.XX.XX.XX:27020) or start watching playcast 

1. Run the game on observer computer with -interactivecaster launch option
1. Connect observer's game to the server as spectator (connect XX.XX.XX.XX:27015, then press 'M' to switch to spectator, will appear on the scoreboard as 'SPEC')
    * Note that the game server will print the following line when your cameraman connects:
    `Adding ID:XXXXXXXX to active caster list!`
1. Verify on the game server that players are connected as expected:
    `status`
    ```
    map     : de_dust2
    gotv[0]:  port 27020, delay 7.0s, rate 32.0
    userid name uniqueid connected ping loss state rate adr
    2 1 "Player1" STEAM_1:1:XXXXXXX 11:35 14 0 active 786432 X.X.X.X:27005
    7 "GOTV" BOT active 32
    10 3 "Player2" STEAM_1:0:XXXXXXX 07:11 17 0 active 786432 X.X.X.X:27005
    ```

    `tv_status`
    
    ```
    --- GOTV[0] Status ---
    Online 11:01, FPS 128.0, Version 8378 (Linux)
    Master "GOTV", delay 7, rate 32.0
    Game Time 10:54, Mod "csgo", Map "de_dust2", Players 2
    Local Slots 128, Spectators 1, Proxies 0
    userid name uniqueid connected ping loss state rate adr
     2 1 "Viewer1" STEAM_1:1:3 07:37 35 0 active 196608 X.X.X.X:27005
    ```
    
1. GOTV viewer should enable caster camera control and caster voice via scoreboard
1. Observer should start switching camera and narrating the action
1. GOTV viewer in our test sees camera switching and caster's in-game voice narration matching the camerawork

## Regulations
*Rules and procedures that pertain to the active administration of the tournaments.*

### Substitutions
Each team can substitute a player with their registered substitute once during the event.

- A team may make a substitution *in-between matches* for any reason. 
- A team may make a substitution *during a match or in-between maps* only in the case of a medical emergency.
- Once a substitution has been made, the team can continue to play with the substitute player until they choose to revert to their Core Lineup.
- The substitution rules above apply if a team chooses to revert to their Core Lineup.
- Once the team reverts to the Core Lineup, it may not substitute again for any reason and must play shorthanded or forfeit if the situation arises.

### Stage Integrity
#### Equipment
The TO will prevent players from bringing any electronics (e.g., pagers, cell phones, etc.) aside from permitted gaming peripherals (mouse, keyboard, etc) to the competition area by employing a metal detector security detail at the entrance.

Any other items players wish to bring on stage must be inspected by the TO staff. 

#### Team staff restrictions
Aside from the TO staff, only the five players and the team's pre-registered coach are permitted in the competition area during event matches.

Coaches are not to communicate with (i.e., be seen, heard, or felt by) the players by any means at any time with the exception of warmup, half-time, and tactical timeouts. 

Coaches that wish to call a timeout are to do so by notifying an admin.

In the case of any matches where event admins are not physically present (e.g. online matches), no team staff, including the coach, may be physically or virtually present or communicate with the players at any time during the match.

<a id="Match-Log-Submissions"></a>
### Match Log Submissions [Major]
Servers must be configured to submit logs and data is to be entered for each match. 

#### Match Log Setup
1. Provide Valve the Steam ID of the account ("Admin") that will be setting and submitting the match logs in order to enable the Control Room.
1. Provide Valve a Web API key for the Admin account. If you don't have one, create one [here.](https://steamcommunity.com/dev)

#### Before Each Match
1. Launch CS from the Admin account, click on Watch, and then click on Control Room button. 
1. Fill out the stage, teams and map for the match about to be played. We suggest formatting the match password as follows: ```teamname1-vs-teamname2-stage-1-of-3-map```
1. On the server the match is to be played on, set the following convars.
```
log on
mp_teamname_1 <Team Name 1>
mp_teamname_2 <Team Name 2>
logaddress_token_secret <match password>
logaddress_add_http <Valve supplied URL>
```

#### After Each Match
Return to the Control Room and click the `SAVE FINAL SCORE` button. This will close out the match in the game for all users and allow them to claim souvenirs. 

## Post-event Tasks
*Obligations that pertain to the completion of the tournaments.*
