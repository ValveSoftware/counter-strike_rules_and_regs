## TOURNAMENT ITEMS
During CS2 Major Championships, we make Team and Player Autograph items available for fans. The goal of these items is to provide some of the experience a fan would have if they had attended the event (e.g., asking you to sign their mousepad, or showing support for their favorite team). Fans can purchase tournament items, and you receive a portion of the proceeds.

### Submit your item
Here are the instructions for submitting a tournament item:
1.	Log into Steam with an account that owns the rights to the image you plan to submit for your tournament item. This does not have to be the account you use to participate in the tournament. **The bank associated with this steam account will be where payment is made.**
    *	Once we ship your item, we cannot change the account that receives payment. Banking information must match the name on your Steam account, and the name on your Steam cannot be changed. Double-check that you are using the account you want us to pay.
2.	Launch CS2. Type **workshop_tournament_item_submit** into the console and press enter.
3.	You will see an item submission form. Select the appropriate image for your submission.
4.	A workshop submission will automatically be created using the image you selected. Visit the workshop item page and complete your submission:
    1.	Complete the revenue sharing section by entering yourself at 100%. DO NOT add other users.
    1.	Accept all legal agreements
    1.	Enter tax and banking information
    1.	Click ‘Finalize’ to complete the submission.

### Guidelines
Items must follow the guidelines below, or they may be rejected. If your item is rejected, you will have to revise your image and make a new submission.

#### Team Items:
The team logo should look exactly as it does in official channels. If your logo does not look like the one represented commonly in media (e.g., on an HLTV or Liquipedia match page), we will likely reject your submission.

#### Player Items:
We want autograph items that look like what you get when you sign a fan’s mousepad. Take a blank sheet of paper, a black marker, and sign your autograph. Take a picture and submit it to us. Easy!

Feel free to practice a few times. You can send us the best one but remember: what you send us should not take you more than 5-10 seconds to write. Your design is up to you--it can be very simple, or funny, or include a few small personal details. But it should not be a very highly designed, complicated, or ornate image. 

Your autograph should follow these rules, otherwise it will likely be rejected or altered before it is shipped:
* The autograph should look the same as when you are signing a fan’s mousepad. It should not take more than 5-10 seconds for you to produce the autograph. If it takes you longer than that, it is too complicated.
* It should be written by YOU, and not by someone else. It is ok if your autograph doesn’t look amazing, as long as it is yours! If someone else has produced your autograph on your behalf, we may reject it.
* These elements in an autograph may cause your submission to be rejected:
    -	Computer-generated art
    -	Fonts
    -	Overly-complicated lettering or drawings (by hand or computer)
    -	Anything that could not reasonably be reproduced by hand in 5-10 seconds.

## FAQ

#### Q. Why was my autograph item rejected?
*A. Autographs are typically rejected when they violate one of the design guidelines (e.g., it was overly complicated, computer-generated, or could not be reasonably reproduced by hand in a few seconds). If you aren’t sure why your item was rejected you can always ask us for feedback.*

#### Q. Why was my autograph altered?
*A. In some cases, the autograph that is submitted to us would be acceptable if one or two small elements were adjusted. Whenever possible we will alert players, prior to shipping, that their original submission may be slightly altered.*

#### Q. Why was my team item rejected?
*A. The image submitted for a team should match the image that represents the team in typical news outlets (e.g., HLTV or Liquipedia). We typically reject modified brand images featuring bespoke designs, or designs featured during special events or on merchandise.*

#### Q. Can I enter a coach/friend/business partner as an additional payee for my submission?
*A. No. Your item should pay directly to the individual who owns the image (the player, in the case of an autograph, or a team representative in the case of the team logo). You should not have more than one account in the revenue share for your tournament item.*

#### Q. Can I change the name associated with my Steam account?
*A. No. Once you have entered a name for your Steam account (e.g., by entering tax information), the name on your account cannot be changed.*

#### Q. Can I change banking information after my item has shipped?
*A. You can change the bank account that receives payment for your item at any time. However, the name on the bank account must match the name on your Steam account, and the name on your Steam account cannot be changed.*

#### Q. My bank is requesting a letter to accompany each monthly payment from Valve, can you provide one?
*A. No, we cannot accommodate banks that request a letter to accompany each monthly payment. Most banks do not require more than a single letter to explain your relationship with Valve, and many do not require any letter at all. If your bank has this requirement, you should seek an alternative.*

#### Q. I entered all of my tax and banking information. Am I done?
*A. No, there’s one last step: clicking the finalize button. The finalize button is a big green button below the revenue sharing section in your submission, and we cannot ship your item until the submission is finalized. Please click that button.*
